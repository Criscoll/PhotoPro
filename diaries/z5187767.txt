=======================    WEEK 3    =======================

October 1st:
I have created the postgres database on Google Cloud Platform. On this database I added and tested
the users table which contains serial ID, first name, last name, email and password.
The email is unique and the serial ID is the primary key.

I also wrote four functions in the backend utils/connect_to_database.py:
    1. create_user: creates a new user in the postgres DB
    2. login_user: checks that the email is unique and matches the given password
    3. change_password: check that the user is logged in and then changes the password to the provided
    4. forgot_password_get_change_password_link: sends email to provided email to change the user's password
