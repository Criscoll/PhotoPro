===== Week 4 =====

10/8/2020

I created a function, 'watermark.py' which lays a semi-transparent watermark over an inputted image,
which will be sourced from the postgres database. I have yet to test this function, given that this is supposed
to be part of the discovery functionality of the web app.
UPDATE:
I revised the watermark.py file this afternoon after some testing, and finally got it to behave correctly;
the 'apply_watermark' function takes in a filename of the base image as an input, and creates a semi-transparent image which serves
as as the watermark which is then applied over the original image. The composite image is then saved, creating a watermarked version of
the original photograph.
I still need to find a way to integrate this functionality into the original user discovery method.
