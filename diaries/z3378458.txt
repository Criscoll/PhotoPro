===== Week 4 =====

10/10/2020

I created a function, 'delete_image_post' in general_user.py to implement the
database backend side of deleting user posts. Some strange behaviour by my dev
enviroment led to the images table in the database being deleted. The function
which takes image_id as an argument does not seem to recieve the image_id
correctly from the function argument and when you
manually insert the integer post id to delete, it works. The test file i wrote
is simply opening a connection and calling the function with a predefine value,
but for some reason the argument is not being passed properly and is the value
10 regardless of what, value the function is called with. I will instal windows
and the linux subsystem on my computer rather than continuning to use Macosx as
this strange behabiour may be solved. I do belive though that the function is
correct, and hence was pushed to my branch db-functions.
UPDATE:
It seems that differences in carriage return on mac caused the second line of
the sql query specifing the entry to be deleted was not parsed properly causing
all entries in the images table to be deleted. When run on ubuntu
this problem is not encountered




===== Week 5 =====


16/10/2020
Today we had out first demo, progressive demo A.
Everything functioned as expected and went smoothly. This week I responded to
other team memebrs queires and tried to assist where possible, and also
performed further testing on the delete_post function I finished last week.
I haven't been able to do as much work on the project this week as I have had a
combined 35% of assement in my other subjects this past week. I'm keen to get
back to work on it next week. I have the tag functions in mind which are a story
in the next sprint
{talk about making sure no errors in delete_post function but manioly doing work
for other subjeccts}
