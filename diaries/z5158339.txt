Week 1

Group formed. As a Scrum master, I created Jira and Github accounts.

Week 2

Together with other members, I have worked on the proposal and wrote user stories. I have wrote out the sprints from Week 3 to Week 9 where I specify which user stories have to be covered for each sprint.

Week 3

Submitted proposal. Started working on the website. Based on sprint 1, we should be able to have the look of the main page done. I started picking up on React and wrote functions to show the search bar and displaying photos on the main page.
Since we decided to use Hooks for React, I got an issue when I can not use React 'props' properly, so I was stucked on that for quite some time. 
Me and Cristian are responsible for front-end, so we are planning to get the main page done by beginning of Week 4, and create a window to post photos.

Week 4

Solved the issue with React 'props' that I have faced with last week. Successfully managed to display the photos on the main page, and make them align without weird gaps.

Week 5

Started implementing the like, comment and bookmark buttons, so that as you hover on each photo card on the discover page, those 3 buttons appear and allow the user to use those functionalities. Started learning how to use grids in CSS in order to build the pages to portray the photo along with it's price, likes, comments, author and other related photos.


Week 6
Struggled with arranging the grids in CSS, by the middle of the week successfully learnt how to use it, and built the basic look of the photos information page. Started learning how to implement infinite scrolling for the main display page.
