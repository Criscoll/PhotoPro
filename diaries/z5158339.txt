Week 1

Group formed. As a Scrum master, I created Jira and Github accounts.

Week 2

Together with other members, I have worked on the proposal and wrote user stories. I have wrote out the sprints from Week 3 to Week 9 where I specify which user stories have to be covered for each sprint.

Week 3

Submitted proposal. Started working on the website. Based on sprint 1, we should be able to have the look of the main page done. I started picking up on React and wrote functions to show the search bar and displaying photos on the main page.

Since we decided to use Hooks for React, I got an issue when I can not use 'props' properly, so I was stucked on that for quite some time.

Me and Cristian are responsible for front-end, so we are planning to get the main page done by beginning of Week 4, and create a window to post photos.

Week 4

=======
Solved the issue with React 'props' that I have faced with last week. Successfully managed to display the photos on the main page, and make them align without weird gaps.
