Week 1

Group formed. As a Scrum master, I created Jira and Github accounts.

Week 2

Together with other members, I have worked on the proposal and wrote user stories. I have wrote out the sprints from Week 3 to Week 9 where I specify which user stories have to be covered for each sprint.

Week 3

Submitted proposal. Started working on the website. Based on sprint 1, we should be able to have the look of the main page done. I started picking up on React and wrote functions to show the search bar and displaying photos on the main page.
Since we decided to use Hooks for React, I got an issue when I can not use React 'props' properly, so I was stucked on that for quite some time. 
Me and Cristian are responsible for front-end, so we are planning to get the main page done by beginning of Week 4, and create a window to post photos.

Week 4

Solved the issue with React 'props' that I have faced with last week. Successfully managed to display the photos on the main page, and make them align nicely without weird gaps. Created a feature where as you hover on each image, the shadow gets add on and 3 buttons "Like", "Bookmark" and "Buy" are shown.

Week 5

Started working on the each post. Learned how to use grid from scratch and spent time designing and aligning the post page. Each post shows the author, number or likes, price and comments. Had some issues with the backend APIs, but through communication figured out the issues. Started working on show likes, making sure that when the user presses the like butron for the second time it would get un-liked. 

Week 6

Started implementing infinite scroll but faced the issue of infinite fetching of the content. Still trying to solve it. Started working on the comments, designing the look and how to stack them on top of each other.

Week 7

Continuing working on comments. Had issues with backend APIs, but solved them by adding extra headers and fixing the variable types. Successfully showed each comment as well as the user who posted it and the date. Managed to design and show the replies to each comment along with showing how many comments are in total for each comment. Managed to delete comments only if you are the one who posted it.
